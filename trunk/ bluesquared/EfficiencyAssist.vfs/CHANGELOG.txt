= Version 3.0.4 (April 2013)
== Notes
* [BUG] Fixed issue where PackingType for USPS was incomplete. (MediumFlatRate instead of MediumFlatRateBox)
* [UPDATE] Depending on the ship via code, EA will assign the correct PackingType. (Flat vs MediumFlatRateBox)

--

= Version 3.0.2 (December 2012)
== Notes
* Priority Mail will now have their packing type automatically inserted. Please NOTE that this could cause issues if we are sending a different type of package!!

= Version 3.0.1 (November 2012)
== Notes
* Fixed issue with canadian zip codes that have a space in them. All zips are now 'cleansed', of hyphens and spaces.

--

= Version 3.0 (May 2012 - October 2012)
== Notes
* Beta 5 has been renamed to Version 3.0

Major Update: This version is updated to work with Process Shipper. And WILL NOT work with SmartLinc.

* Third Party: It is now required to put the Customer Code, and Account number into EA before creating shipments for that customer. This is required by Process Shipper.

* File Names: File names that are output from EA now are not preceded by a # sign, because of PS.

* Preferences: You will now be able to choose specific directories. Such as what you want the default directory to be when opening a file, saving a file, or archiving.

# Character Limitations: There is now a 35 character limit for all fields. If data ends up being longer than 35 characters it will automatically be truncated!
# Phone Numbers and Pkg Id fields (What we use for the version and box qty), are 15 characters!

* Progress Window: A notice will now display when EA is processing a file and will change when processing has completed.

* International: PS requires a vast amount of information than SmartLinc did. Most settings can be configured in Preferences. The defaults should not need to be changed.
# Because PS requires all International packages to have a unique PkgId; EA will automatically insert an alphabetical letter before the box qty and version.

* New Version: I have implemented a New Version window, so that when you launch the new version for the first time you will see a notice asking if you would like to see the change log, and immediately see information regarding new features.

== Notes
Minor maintenance update.

== Bug Fixes
* No longer need to exit EA for the completed file to be written
* Progressbar works as it should

--

= Version 2.0 (August 2011)
== Notes
The big features on this release are:
* Progress Window
* User settable Headers
* Importable piece weights; the header to use is 'pieceweight'
* Importable Full Box quantities; the header to use is 'fullbox'

You will now see how far Efficiency Assist has processed your file with a progress bar. Once EA has finished, the total quantity and total quantity of boxes will be displayed

You will now be able to set your own header values. Meaning, if you come across a header that is spelled differently for 'Address', you will now be able to insert that variation so EA will assign it to the correct field.

== New Features
* Progress window and stat display
* Enter or Import 3rd party codes
* Changelog and About window has been implemented.
* Set a 3rd Party Acct Number (Importable)
* Set a Contact and Email Address (Importable) - Currently does not allow the user to type in the values. Must be imported.
* Displays your current file name
* Headers now are user-settable

== Bug Fixes
* Correctly imports headers with spaces before or after the name.
* Fixed Reset to work properly
# Leading zero on zip codes partially works
# Will not add additional leading zero's. (i.e. 0993 vs 00993)
