= These are user specific options =

== Variables ==
*mySettings(saveFilePath)*
So we can auto-save instead of having to ask the user where to save.

*mySettings(saveFilePathCopy)*
For a backup copy / archival reasons

*mySettings(userSourceFiles)*
This is the location where the user will place "to import files", so we will want to open at this location when looking for those files.
