Setup of Email will be in its own designated section, called _EmailSetup_

This window will contain multiple tabs, the first one being:
*Email Setup*; configure the server, port, TLS if using etc.


*Batch Maker/Box Labels*; configure who we are sending the email to and from.
This should be controlled by a dropdown, which indicates what event generates the email. There should also be an area where you can add your own Header/Footer, Subject line information.
