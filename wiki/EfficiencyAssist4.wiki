See issue 86 for the associated issues with this release.

*OVERVIEW*
This release will contain all addresses in a database. You will open the file, assign values to the correct fields (all except pieceweight, fullbox),  and “import” it into the database.

Once imported, will then be able to assign pieceweights, fullbox qty’s and other shipment specific information.

The person generating the batch, will type in the job number, which will bring up statistics of the addresses (i.e. total count, total destinations, by version), and if there are multiple ship dates, it will give you the opportunity to select a specific ship date, or select all.

Once you have a the Batch Creator open, you can modify the day it ships (which will affect the scheduler), insert pieceweights and fullbox qty’s per version. 

  * Must have the ability to search on old jobs (customer, description, number) to retrieve historical information. Mainly pieceweight, qty per box
