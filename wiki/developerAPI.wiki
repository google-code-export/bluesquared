= API =

API for modules communicating with Core.


= Setup =
Commands that allow Core to know if the active module needs to be Setup before it can be used.

Each package adds variables to the `setup()` array, within the `namespace eval` proc.
{{{
set setup($packageName,identifier) <value>
}}}

To determine if we require a setup before using, each package should use this sytanx
{{{
setup($packageName,setupReqd) <yes/no>
}}}

That way we can create a `proc` to look at those variables, to determine if we need to process it further. Such as looking to see if the setup on it has been complete or not.

Once setup has been *completed* lets issue another variable
{{{
set setup($packageName,setupComplete) <yes/no>
}}}

Using the *`package`* command, we can figure out what packages are loaded. Then lets filter on the *`eAssist_`* keyword that we use to prefix all of the project-centric packages.

{{{
foreach value [package names] {
    if {[string match eAssist_* $value] == 1} {
        puts $value
        }
}
}}}
